# UI for my Z80 emulator library.

## Status: WIP

## Description

This project is a UI for my Z80 emulator library.  

## Compatibility

In order to make it compatible with as many devices as possible I made the choice of compiling it into web assembly.  
This way it can run on any device that has a relatively modern browser.
Another advantage of it being a web assembly is that it can be easily embedded into any website.

## This project will serve as my Computer Science Bachelor's project.
